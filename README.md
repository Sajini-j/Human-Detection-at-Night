Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Collect and preprocess a diverse dataset containing nighttime images with annotated human figures.
Model Architecture:
CNN-LSTM:
Employ CNN to extract spatial features from the images.
Use LSTM to capture temporal dependencies and improve detection accuracy over sequences of frames.
YOLO:
Implement the YOLO algorithm for real-time object detection.
Train YOLO on the nighttime dataset to enhance its performance in low-light conditions.
Training and Evaluation:
Train the models on the collected dataset using appropriate loss functions and optimization techniques.
Evaluate the models on a separate test set to measure their performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and processing time.
